Overall Project Statements:</br>
My theme was books, all the games had some book-related components and I used a black and white style to symbolize books. This website is meant to appeal to fellow book lovers.
All the images are cited in the code right before the place they are used, and all of them have alt tags.
All the pages are keyboard navigable and pressing the arrow buttons or tab buttons can take you to all the pages.
The contrast of black and white style that I used throughout the project and appealing fonts were good for accessibility as well as they were easy on the eyes. 
I implemented two games from scratch, hangman and flip coins. I adapted a card flip game from a licensed, open source github repo. You can access the games from index.html.

Main Page Documentation('index.html', 'index.js', and 'style.css')</br>
On the main page, index.html, there are clickable icons with an image representing the game and a brief description about the game; it was fairly easy to code. I used event listeners for the arrow keys so itâ€™s possible to use the arrow or tab keys and the enter button to get to any of the 3 game pages without having to click anything.  I made it responsive so that on a smaller, mobile screen the game icons would take up a variable amount of space based on the page width rather than the fixed size they had for desktop view. This is the interface where people can access the 3 games on the site. Style.css is used for all the othe pages as well, so a similar heaader and footer pattern will be on the other sites and will lend an aesthetic uniformity to my website.
